# World-Bank-Data

This project is an HTML file that defines the structure and content of a web page for displaying World Bank data. The web page uses the Chart.js library to create a chart that displays the values of a selected indicator for the United States between 1973 and 2022. The web page also includes a drop-down menu to select the indicator and two buttons to generate the chart and download the data in CSV format.
